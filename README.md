# EEG_Classification


Main idea: we take 4 ssvep frequencies and map them to controlling a drone, maybe even in a race 
small ideas / todos:
- work on filtering such as melspectrogram fft or normalisations to get rid of filter 
- work on integrating it into drone control 
- work on live usage

do we still need lightning_logs ? 
do we need to upload __pycache__ ?
